# Description

Given an integers sequence a=(a1, a2,…, an). A subsequence of aa is defined to be ai, ai+1,…, aj. The weight of a subsequence is the sum of its elements. Find the subsequence having the highest weight.

Input

- Line 1 contains n (1≤n≤10^6)

- Line 2 contains a1,…,an (−500≤ai≤500)

Output

Write the weight of the highest subsequence found.

Example
