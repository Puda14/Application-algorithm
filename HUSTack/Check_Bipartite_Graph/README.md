# Description

Given an undirected graph G=(V, E) in which V={1,…, N} is the set of nodes and |E|=M. You are required to write a program to check if G is a bipartite graph.

Input

- Line 1 N and M (1≤N, M≤10^5)

- Line i+1 (i=1,…, M): u and v which are endpoints of the ith edge

Output

Write 1 if G is a bipartite graph and 0, otherwise.
