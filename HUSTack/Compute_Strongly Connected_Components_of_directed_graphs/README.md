# Description

Given a directed graph G=(V,E) where V={1,. . ., N} is the number of nodes and the set E has M arcs. Compute number of strongly connected components of G

Input

- Line 1: two positive integers N and M (1 <= N <= 10^5, 1 <= M <= 10^6)

- Line i+1 (i=1,. . ., M): contains two positive integers u and v which are endpoints of ith arc

Output
